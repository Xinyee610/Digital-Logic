### âœ¨Reflection: <br>
Studying Digital Logic has deepened my understanding of the basic building blocks of digital systems. I have learned about basic logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT and how they can be used to develop combinational logic circuits. From this, I learned how to design and develop circuits of varied functionality, enhancing my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.

The subject has given me a very solid groundwork in digital electronics, which forms the basis of more complicated systems such as microprocessors and digital devices. This was made possible through the use of theoretical concepts together with practical experiments to connect the gap between the abstract and the real world.
